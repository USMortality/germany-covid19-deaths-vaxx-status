# Final Review Summary

## Repository: `germany-covid19-vaccine-efficacy-missing-data`

### ✅ Analysis Complete

**Key Finding**: 76% of Germany's COVID-19 deaths (2021-2024) had unknown vaccination status, making vaccine efficacy calculations impossible.

**Conservative Estimate**: -212% efficacy (vaccinated died at 3.12x the rate)
- **BUT**: Entirely dependent on assumptions about 114,709 unknowns
- **Range**: -212% to +92% depending on plausible assumptions

## Key Results

### Main Calculation (Unknowns = Knowns Distribution)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Vaccine Efficacy** | **-212%** |
| **Risk Ratio** | 3.12 |
| **Vaccinated death rate** | 2.13 per 1,000 |
| **Unvaccinated death rate** | 0.68 per 1,000 |

### Data Quality Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Unknown vaccination status | 76% (114,709 out of 150,709) |
| Age stratification | None |
| Temporal granularity | Annual only (need monthly) |
| Comorbidities | None |
| Vaccination details (doses, timing) | None |

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Assumption | % Unknowns Unvax | Efficacy |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Unknowns = knowns | 8.3% | **-212%** |
| Unknowns = population | 22.1% | **-22%** |
| Agnostic (50/50) | 50% | **+58%** |
| All unknowns unvax | 100% | **+92%** |

## Critical Limitations (Emphasized in Analysis)

### 1. Missing Data ⭐ PRIMARY ISSUE
- 76% unknown vaccination status
- No reliable estimate possible with 3/4 missing data

### 2. Age Confounding ⭐ CRITICAL CONFOUNDER
- **NO age stratification** in the data
- Age is strongest predictor of COVID mortality
- Elderly vaccinated first → creates Simpson's paradox potential
- **Crude rates are meaningless without age adjustment**

### 3. Other Confounders
- No comorbidity data
- No prior infection data
- No temporal granularity
- No vaccination timing data

## Key Messages

### For Technical Audience:
"Without age stratification and with 76% missing data, no valid efficacy estimate is possible. The -212% estimate assumes unknowns follow knowns (standard approach), but the sensitivity range is -212% to +92%."

### For General Audience:
"Germany made public health policy while missing vaccination status for 3 out of 4 COVID deaths. We literally don't know if vaccines helped or harmed because the data quality is catastrophically poor."

### For Skeptics:
"Even the conservative estimate showing negative efficacy (-212%) is unreliable due to massive missing data and lack of age adjustment. The real scandal is the data quality, not any specific efficacy number."

## Reproducibility

All analysis can be reproduced:
```bash
cd covid_analysis
Rscript src/final_ve_calculation.R
Rscript src/covid_ve_calc.R
Rscript src/covid_deaths_grouped.R
```

Dependencies: R with `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`

## Summary

**What we found**: Depending on assumptions, efficacy ranges from -212% to +92%

**What it means**: We can't determine efficacy from this data

**Real finding**: 76% unknown status + no age data = data quality catastrophe

**Action item**: Demand better data transparency from public health authorities
