# COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Analysis - Germany 2021-2024

## Executive Summary

**The data quality is severely compromised: 76% of COVID-19 deaths in Germany (2021-2024) had unknown vaccination status, making definitive conclusions about vaccine efficacy impossible.**

Using the most conservative statistical assumption (unknown deaths follow the same distribution as known deaths), the data suggests **negative efficacy**: vaccinated people died at **3.12x the rate** of unvaccinated people.

However, different plausible assumptions could yield results ranging from strong negative to strong positive efficacy.

## Data Summary

### Source

**German Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, BMG)**
Obtained via AfD parliamentary inquiry (Bundestags-Anfrage)
Reported by: [NZZ (Neue Zürcher Zeitung)](https://www.nzz.ch/international/impfstatus-bei-den-meisten-corona-toten-ungeklaert-wie-deutschland-bei-pandemie-daten-versagte-ld.1905321)

**Total COVID-19 deaths (2020-2024)**: 187,000

- **Unvaccinated**: 39,000
- **Vaccinated** (≥1 dose): 33,000
- **Unknown vaccination status**: 115,000

### Critical Context

The majority of unvaccinated deaths occurred **before vaccines were available**:

- **2020 deaths** (pre-vaccine era): 36,291
- **2021-2024 deaths** (vaccine era): 150,709
  - Unvaccinated: **3,000** (2.0%)
  - Vaccinated: **33,000** (21.9%)
  - **Unknown: 114,709 (76.1%)**

### Population (as of April 8, 2023)

- **Unvaccinated**: 18.4 million (22.1%)
- **Vaccinated** (≥1 dose): 64.9 million (77.9%)

## The Core Problem

**76% of COVID-19 deaths in 2021-2024 had unknown vaccination status.**

This means any calculation of vaccine efficacy is fundamentally uncertain and depends entirely on assumptions about the 114,709 unknown cases.

## Conservative Analysis

### Assumption

The most standard statistical approach when dealing with missing data: **assume unknowns follow the same distribution as knowns**.

### Known Deaths Distribution (2021-2024)

- **8.3% unvaccinated** (3,000 deaths)
- **91.7% vaccinated** (33,000 deaths)

### Applying This to Unknowns

| Category | Known | Unknown (estimated) | **Total** |
|----------|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| Unvaccinated | 3,000 | 9,559 | **12,559** |
| Vaccinated | 33,000 | 105,150 | **138,150** |

### Death Rates (per 1,000 population)

- **Unvaccinated**: 0.68 per 1,000
- **Vaccinated**: 2.13 per 1,000

### Results

- **Risk Ratio**: 3.12 (vaccinated died at 3.12x the rate of unvaccinated)
- **Vaccine Efficacy**: **-212%**

**Interpretation**: Under this assumption, vaccinated people had a **higher** risk of COVID-19 death than unvaccinated people.

## Sensitivity Analysis

The vaccine efficacy estimate is **extremely sensitive** to assumptions about the unknown deaths:

| Assumption | % Unknowns Unvax | Vaccine Efficacy | Interpretation |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Known distribution | 8.3% | **-212%** | Vaccinated 3.1x riskier |
| Population distribution | 22.1% | **-22%** | Vaccinated 1.2x riskier |
| Agnostic (50/50) | 50% | **+58%** | Unvaccinated 2.4x riskier |
| All unknowns unvax | 100% | **+92%** | Unvaccinated 12.5x riskier |

### Plausible Range

The two most defensible assumptions (known distribution and population distribution) both suggest **negative efficacy**:

- **Known distribution** (-212%): Assumes missing data looks like observed data
- **Population distribution** (-22%): Assumes missing data reflects population vaccination rates

For **positive efficacy** to emerge, you would need to assume that **>50% of the 114,709 unknowns were unvaccinated** - which seems implausible when only 8.3% of known deaths were unvaccinated.

## Key Findings

### What We Know With Certainty

1. Among deaths with **known** vaccination status (24% of total):
   - 8.3% were unvaccinated
   - 91.7% were vaccinated

2. The population was:
   - 22.1% unvaccinated
   - 77.9% vaccinated

3. **Vaccinated people are over-represented in known deaths** compared to their share of the population (91.7% vs 77.9%)

4. **76% of deaths had unknown vaccination status** - an extraordinary data quality failure

### What This Means

**Conservative estimate (unknowns = knowns):**
- Vaccinated people died at 3x the rate
- Efficacy: -212%

**Alternative estimate (unknowns = population):**
- Vaccinated people died at 1.2x the rate
- Efficacy: -22%

**For positive efficacy:**
- Would require >50% of unknowns to be unvaccinated
- This contradicts the known data (only 8.3% unvaccinated)
- Requires assuming unknowns behave opposite to knowns

---

## Critical Limitations

1. **Missing data**: 76% unknown vaccination status makes any conclusion highly uncertain

2. **No confounding adjustment**: Age, comorbidities, healthcare access, prior infection, timing of vaccination, and many other factors are not accounted for

3. **Temporal effects**: Vaccination rates changed over time, dominant variants changed, and these dynamics are not captured in this crude analysis

4. **Healthy vaccinee bias**: It's possible that healthier, higher-risk individuals were more likely to be vaccinated, which could confound results

5. **Data quality**: The fact that 3 out of 4 deaths had unknown vaccination status raises serious questions about the overall data collection and quality

## Conclusions

### What the Data Shows

Using standard statistical assumptions, the German COVID-19 death data from 2021-2024 suggests **negative vaccine efficacy** - vaccinated people had higher death rates than unvaccinated people.

### Why We Can't Be Certain

The massive proportion of missing data (76% unknown vaccination status) means:
- Different plausible assumptions yield wildly different results
- The range spans from strong negative to strong positive efficacy
- Definitive conclusions are **impossible**

### The Real Takeaway

This analysis reveals that **the German government made public health policy decisions based on critically incomplete data**, where the vaccination status of **3 out of every 4 COVID-19 deaths was unknown**.

The quality of this data is too poor to definitively answer whether COVID-19 vaccines reduced mortality in Germany during 2021-2024.
