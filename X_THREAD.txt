🚨 BREAKING: German govt data shows vaccinated died at 3x the rate of unvaccinated.

Vaccinated: 2.13 per 1,000
Unvaccinated: 0.68 per 1,000

But there's a problem...

76% of deaths have UNKNOWN vaccination status.

[IMAGE: See the massive gray "unknown" bar - 114,709 unknowns vs 36,000 knowns]

They imposed mandates, lockdowns & fired workers based on data where 3 out of 4 deaths were... unknowns.

The 3x death rate assumes unknowns follow the same pattern as knowns (8.3% unvaccinated).

This is the standard statistical approach for missing data—but with 76% unknown, ANY conclusion is highly uncertain.

Here's why it matters...

But here's the problem: this ENTIRELY depends on assumptions about the 114,709 unknowns.

Different plausible assumptions yield:
• -212% efficacy (unknowns = knowns)
• -22% efficacy (unknowns = population)
• +58% efficacy (50/50 split)
• +92% efficacy (all unknowns unvax)

The sensitivity is EXTREME. Here's what efficacy looks like across all possible assumptions:

The blue line (8.3% = known dist.) shows -212% efficacy.
The purple line (22.1% = population) shows -22% efficacy.

Even IF we knew the vaccination status, there's a critical confounding problem:

NO AGE STRATIFICATION.

Age is the strongest predictor of COVID mortality. Elderly were vaccinated first. Without age adjustment, comparing crude rates is meaningless.

This is Epidemiology 101.

What data would be needed for a proper analysis?

🔴 CRITICAL:
• <5% unknown status (not 76%!)
• Age-stratified deaths (80+ vs 20-29, etc.)

🟡 HIGH PRIORITY:
• Monthly data (not annual)
• Doses + timing
• Comorbidities

Currently we have NONE of this.

TWEET 8/11
The known case distribution (8.3% unvax, 91.7% vax) shows vaccinated were heavily over-represented in deaths.

But without age data, we can't say why. Were vaccinated people older? Sicker?

This is why age stratification is critical—and Germany hasn't published it.

Context: Age-standardized excess mortality in Germany:
• 2020 (pre-vax): -0.6% (BELOW baseline)
• 2021 (vax rollout): +1.14%
• 2022 (77.9% vaxed): +4.70% (PEAK)
• 2023: +0.98%
• 2024: -1.4%

Excess deaths peaked DURING mass vaccination, not before.

Let that sink in: Lockdowns. Mask mandates. Vaccine passports. Job terminations.

All based on data where they didn't even know vaccination status for 3 out of 4 deaths.

76% unknown isn't a "data gap"—it's making life-altering policy decisions in the dark.
